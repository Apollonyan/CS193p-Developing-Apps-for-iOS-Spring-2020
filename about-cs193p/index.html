      <h1>关于 CS193p</h1>
      <p>
        Stanford's CS193p course, Developing Applications for iOS, explains the fundamentals of how
        to
        build applications for iPhone and iPad using SwiftUI. Most recently offered in Spring
        quarter
        2020, the lectures were given to Stanford students in an on-line format due to the novel
        coronavirus pandemic. Stanford is in the process of making these on-line lecture videos
        available for all via YouTube (two per week).
      </p>

      <p>
        On this site, you will be able to find materials that were distributed to students during
        the
        quarter such as homework assignment write-ups and demo code. Unfortunately, we cannot offer
        any of the same kind of direct support we gave our students (on-line Q&A and office hours
        with
        teaching staff, homework grading, etc.), but the materials posted here should still be
        helpful
        in understanding the lectures as you watch. As we emphasize to our students, doing the
        homework assignments is absolutely essential to learning the material in this course.
      </p>

      <p>
        SwiftUI is brand new, having only shipped a few months before this course was taught. Thus
        it
        may well be that by the time you are watching it, some of the course's content will already
        be
        out of date as updates to SwiftUI occur, requiring some adjustment as you watch. That is
        normal for new technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        The material in this course was not developed with the involvement of, nor was it vetted by,
        anyone at Apple, so it should not be perceived as "the truth" for how to develop using
        SwiftUI. We've done our best to understand this technology ourselves in the short time it
        has
        been out and then share what we've learned. Enjoy!
